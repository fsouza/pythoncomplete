pythoncomplete
==============

This is a fork of the current pythoncomplete omnicomplete function with
enhancements from
[mjbrownie/pythoncomplete.vim](https://github.com/mjbrownie/pythoncomplete.vim),
and Python 3 support.

This has been tested with Python 3 and Neovim only, please let me know if you
find any kind of issue.
